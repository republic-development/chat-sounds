# Chat Sounds addon for Garry's Mod
When a player says a word, phrase or short sentence in local chat, they will emit a sound that everyone can hear in the 3D environment.

For example, this is the type of system the DarkRP gamemode uses when a player types "Yeah" and emits the sound "vo/npc/male01/yeah02.wav".
