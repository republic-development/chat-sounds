# Chat Sounds addon for Garry's Mod DarkRP
When a player says a word, phrase or short sentence in local chat, they will emit a sound that everyone can hear in the 3D environment.

For example, a player types "Yeah" and emits the sound "vo/npc/male01/yeah02.wav".

This integrates directly into the DarkRP gamemode and does not conflict with DarkRP's chat sounds system.

# Requirements
DarkRP gamemode version 2.5 or higher
